Restaurant Ordering System
This project simulates a restaurant ordering system where customers can browse a menu, place orders, and view order history. The system follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, utilizing inheritance and encapsulation to structure the restaurant's functionality efficiently.

Core Functionalities
1. Menu Management
Stores a collection of dishes categorized into appetizers, entrees, and desserts.
Allows customers to view the menu and select items.
2. Dish Categorization (Inheritance)
A base class (Dish) represents a generic dish with common attributes.
Specialized dish types (Appetizer, Entree, Dessert) inherit from Dish and may include unique attributes or behaviors.
3. Customer Management
Stores customer name and contact information.
Maintains a record of past orders for each customer.
4. Order Processing
An order consists of:
Customer details
List of selected dishes
Total price calculation
Orders are stored and linked to customers.
5. Order History & Review
Customers can view their previous orders, including order details and total cost.
6. Restaurant System Management
Manages the menu, customers, and order records.
Provides options for placing orders, reviewing menus, and checking order history.

System Flow

Displaying the Menu

Customer Interaction

If it is their first time, the system records their name and contact information.
